# ICD-10 Code Mapping Configuration
# This file maps vocabulary indices to ICD-10 codes for hierarchical loss computation
# 
# Format:
#   icd_codes:
#     <vocab_index>: "<ICD-10-CM code>"
#
# Example structure (simplified):
# - E10-E14: Diabetes mellitus
#   - E11: Type 2 diabetes mellitus
#     - E11.6: Type 2 diabetes mellitus with other specified complications
#       - E11.65: Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia
#       - E11.69: Type 2 diabetes mellitus with other specified complication
#     - E11.9: Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications
# - I10-I15: Hypertensive diseases
#   - I10: Essential (primary) hypertension
# - J40-J47: Chronic lower respiratory diseases
#   - J44: Other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

icd_codes:
  # Diabetes mellitus (Type 2)
  0: "E11.65"  # Type 2 diabetes with hyperglycemia
  1: "E11.69"  # Type 2 diabetes with other complication
  2: "E11.9"   # Type 2 diabetes without complications
  3: "E11.21"  # Type 2 diabetes with diabetic nephropathy
  4: "E11.22"  # Type 2 diabetes with diabetic chronic kidney disease
  
  # Diabetes mellitus (Type 1)
  5: "E10.65"  # Type 1 diabetes with hyperglycemia
  6: "E10.9"   # Type 1 diabetes without complications
  
  # Hypertension
  7: "I10"     # Essential (primary) hypertension
  8: "I11.0"   # Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure
  9: "I11.9"   # Hypertensive heart disease without heart failure
  
  # Respiratory diseases
  10: "J44.0"  # COPD with acute lower respiratory infection
  11: "J44.1"  # COPD with acute exacerbation
  12: "J44.9"  # COPD, unspecified
  13: "J45.20" # Mild intermittent asthma, uncomplicated
  14: "J45.30" # Mild persistent asthma, uncomplicated
  
  # Cardiovascular diseases
  15: "I21.0"  # ST elevation myocardial infarction
  16: "I21.4"  # Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction
  17: "I25.10" # Atherosclerotic heart disease
  
  # Mental and behavioral disorders
  18: "F32.0"  # Mild depressive episode
  19: "F32.1"  # Moderate depressive episode
  20: "F32.2"  # Severe depressive episode without psychotic features
  21: "F41.0"  # Panic disorder
  22: "F41.1"  # Generalized anxiety disorder
  
  # Infectious diseases
  23: "A41.9"  # Sepsis, unspecified organism
  24: "J18.9"  # Pneumonia, unspecified organism
  25: "N39.0"  # Urinary tract infection
  
  # NOTE: For a complete medical application, you would need to map
  # all codes in your vocabulary. This is a demonstration subset.
  # The remaining indices (26-499) would map to additional ICD-10 codes.
  # 
  # You can extend this file based on your actual ICD vocabulary:
  # - Download ICD-10-CM codes from: https://www.cms.gov/medicare/coding-billing/icd-10-codes
  # - Map your model's vocabulary indices to actual ICD codes
  # - Group related codes under the same categories for better hierarchical loss
